    "#### Solution\n",
    "            \n",
    "##### Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Courses and prerequisites can be represented as nodes and edges in a directed graph, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "Course 0 is a node. Course 1 is also a node. If course 0 is a prerequisite for course 1, this is an edge between 1 and 0. This is represented by a pair [1,0]\n",
    "\n",
    "A course can be a requirement for multiple other courses, e.g. one node can have many children.\n",
    "A course can have multiple requirements, e.g. a node can be a child to multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case the graph is not fully connected, the courses can still be completed. This means there are courses that have no requirements, or just isolated connected components, whose requirements can be fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "A condition for completion is that we're able to see all nodes, starting from nodes that have no requirements (they are not a child node of any node). If all nodes have requirements, this means that the we can't even start the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2 shows that we won't be able to complete course 0 if we don't take course 1 and vice-versa. This indicates a cycle in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to complete all courses means that there is no cycle in the graph. Not detecting a cycle in the graph means we can comoplete all courses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Solution Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign an in-degree to each node. The in-degree answers the question: \"How many nodes is this node a child of\". We start from nodes that have in-degree = 0. The requirements for those nodes have already been completed. We add those nodes to the queue. For each of their children, we decrement their in-degree (one of the requirements was fulfilled). If the in-degree is 0 (all requirements have been fulfilled), we add the child to the queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a cycle means that we will have a node in the graph that always has an in-degree higher than what can be reached doing BFS and decrementing. That node will never end up on the queue, which means we won't see all nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Time complexity is O(E), because we traverse every edge in the graph.\n",
    "Space complexity is O(N), because we store the children and in-degrees for every node\n",
