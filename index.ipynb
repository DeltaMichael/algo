    "3. We pick the right subtree, add current value to it and continue traversing\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Description\n",
    "```\n",
    "Base case:\n",
    "    If current node is null -> return 0\n",
    "Common case:\n",
    "    traverse left subtree recursively\n",
    "    traverse right subtree recursively\n",
    "    pick the max of 0 and left sum\n",
    "    pick the max of 0 and right sum\n",

    "Courses and prerequisites can be represented as nodes and edges in a directed graph, e.g.\n",

    "Course 0 is a node. Course 1 is also a node. If course 0 is a prerequisite for course 1, this is an edge between 1 and 0. This is represented by a pair [1,0]\n",

    "##### Solution Description\n",
    "\n",
    "We assign an in-degree to each node. The in-degree answers the question: \"How many nodes is this node a child of\". We start from nodes that have in-degree = 0. The requirements for those nodes have already been completed. We add those nodes to the queue. For each of their children, we decrement their in-degree (one of the requirements was fulfilled). If the in-degree is 0 (all requirements have been fulfilled), we add the child to the queue.\n",

    "##### Complexity Analysis\n",
